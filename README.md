This repository demonstrates a common coding error in Python and how to fix it. The file `bug.py` contains the buggy code that throws a `ZeroDivisionError`, while `bugSolution.py` provides the corrected version. The error arises from dividing by zero when calculating the average of an empty list. The solution is to explicitly check if the list is empty before performing the division.
